Requirements:

Boost is used for program_options, filesystem, and regex: http://www.boost.org/

The function and basis set writers require GiNaC: http://www.ginac.de/

The python example script py_test.py uses matplotlib: http://matplotlib.org/


Installing:

You might need to set the following environments variables:

BIN: Where to install 'fw' and 'bsw'. If not set, uses /usr/local/bin.
BOOST: Where to find boost include files and libraries. Assumes $(BOOST)/include for headers and $(BOOST)/lib for libraries. If not set, uses default compiler search path.
GINAC: Where to find GiNaC and CLN include files and libraries. Assumes $(GINAC)/include for headers and $(GINAC)/lib for libraries. If not set, uses default compiler search path.

The IntegrationTools header files are assumed to be installed in the default compiler search path.

Then cd to the IntegrationToolsWriter root directory and make and install with: 'make install'

'make install' will make and install:
- 'fw': The Function Writer
- 'bsw': The Basis Set Writer


Testing:

You can run a test with: 'make test'
